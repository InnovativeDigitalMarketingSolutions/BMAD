#### Specific Event Handlers
The agent registers handlers for the following events:

1. **USER_STORY_REQUESTED** - `_handle_user_story_requested`
   - Creates user stories based on requirements
   - Publishes USER_STORY_CREATED or USER_STORY_CREATION_FAILED events

2. **BACKLOG_UPDATE_REQUESTED** - `_handle_backlog_update_requested`
   - Processes backlog updates and prioritization
   - Publishes BACKLOG_UPDATED or BACKLOG_UPDATE_FAILED events

3. **PRODUCT_VISION_REQUESTED** - `_handle_product_vision_requested`
   - Generates product vision documents
   - Publishes PRODUCT_VISION_CREATED or PRODUCT_VISION_CREATION_FAILED events

4. **STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS_REQUESTED** - `_handle_stakeholder_analysis_requested`
   - Performs stakeholder analysis
   - Publishes STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS_COMPLETED or STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS_FAILED events

5. **FEEDBACK_RECEIVED** - `_handle_feedback_received`
   - Processes incoming feedback and determines actions
   - Publishes FEEDBACK_PROCESSED or FEEDBACK_PROCESSING_FAILED events

6. **TASK_DELEGATED** - `_handle_task_delegated`
   - Accepts and processes delegated tasks
   - Publishes TASK_COMPLETED or TASK_FAILED events

### New Event Types Added

The following event types were added to support ProductOwner functionality:

#### Product Development Events
- `USER_STORY_REQUESTED` - Request for user story creation
- `USER_STORIES_CREATED` - Multiple user stories created
- `USER_STORY_CREATION_FAILED` - User story creation failed

#### Backlog Management Events
- `BACKLOG_UPDATE_REQUESTED` - Request for backlog update
- `BACKLOG_UPDATED` - Backlog successfully updated
- `BACKLOG_UPDATE_FAILED` - Backlog update failed

#### Product Vision Events
- `PRODUCT_VISION_REQUESTED` - Request for product vision
- `PRODUCT_VISION_CREATED` - Product vision created
- `PRODUCT_VISION_CREATION_FAILED` - Product vision creation failed

#### Stakeholder Analysis Events
- `STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS_REQUESTED` - Request for stakeholder analysis
- `STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS_COMPLETED` - Stakeholder analysis completed
- `STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS_FAILED` - Stakeholder analysis failed

#### Feedback Events
- `FEEDBACK_PROCESSED` - Feedback successfully processed
- `FEEDBACK_PROCESSING_FAILED` - Feedback processing failed

### Event Categories Added

New event categories were added to organize related events:

- `user_stories` - All user story related events
- `backlog` - All backlog management events
- `product_management` - All product management events

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes

#### 1. Agent Class Updates
- Extended `AgentMessageBusIntegration` instead of standalone class
- Added `super().__init__("ProductOwner")` call
- Implemented `initialize_message_bus()` method

#### 2. Event Handler Implementation
- Created 6 async event handler methods
- Each handler processes incoming events and publishes response events
- Implemented error handling with failure event publishing

#### 3. Method Updates
- Updated `run()` and `run_async()` methods to initialize message bus
- Converted `collaborate_example()` to async method
- Updated `create_bmad_frontend_story()` to async method
- Replaced old message bus calls with new integration methods

#### 4. Import Updates
- Replaced old message bus imports with new `bmad.core.message_bus` imports
- Added `EventTypes` and `get_message_bus` imports

### Helper Methods

The agent includes several helper methods for processing different types of tasks:

- `_process_backlog_update()` - Sorts backlog items by priority
- `_generate_product_vision()` - Creates product vision documents
- `_perform_stakeholder_analysis()` - Analyzes stakeholder information
- `_process_feedback()` - Processes feedback and determines actions
- `_process_delegated_task()` - Handles different types of delegated tasks

## Testing

### Test Suite
A comprehensive test suite was created: `tests/unit/agents/test_product_owner_integration.py`

#### Test Coverage
- ✅ Agent initialization and message bus integration
- ✅ Event handler registration and functionality
- ✅ Event publishing and subscription
- ✅ Collaboration capabilities
- ✅ Task delegation and acceptance
- ✅ Error handling in event handlers
- ✅ Helper method functionality

#### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 21
- **Passed**: 21
- **Failed**: 0
- **Success Rate**: 100%

## Integration Benefits

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- Agents can now communicate through standardized events
- Decoupled communication enables better scalability
- Event history provides audit trail

### 2. Collaboration Capabilities
- ProductOwner can request collaboration from other agents
- Task delegation enables workload distribution
- Inter-agent communication supports complex workflows

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful error handling with failure event publishing
- Event-based error reporting enables monitoring
- Consistent error handling across all agents

### 4. Extensibility
- Easy to add new event types and handlers
- Modular design supports future enhancements
- Standardized integration pattern for other agents

## Usage Examples

### Creating User Stories
```python
# Agent can handle user story requests
await agent._handle_user_story_requested({
    "requirement": "User login feature",
    "user_type": "end_user",
    "priority": "high"
})
```

### Processing Backlog Updates
```python
# Agent can process backlog updates
await agent._handle_backlog_update_requested({
    "backlog_items": [...],
    "prioritization_method": "value_effort"
})
```

### Collaborating with Other Agents
```python
# Agent can request collaboration
await agent.request_collaboration({
    "task": "Create user stories",
    "agents": ["Architect", "Developer"],
    "priority": "high"
}, "Create user stories")
```

## Next Steps
