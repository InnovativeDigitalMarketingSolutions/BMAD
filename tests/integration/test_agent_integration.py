"""
Agent Integration Tests for BMAD System

This module tests agent integration functionality to ensure
agents can work together and communicate effectively.

Test Coverage:
- Agent initialization and setup
- Agent communication patterns
- Workflow execution across agents
- Error handling and recovery
