# Robust Message Bus Implementation

## Overview
This implementation addresses the root cause of JSON corruption in shared_context.json by implementing:

1. **Atomic File Operations**: Write to temporary file first, then atomic move
2. **Enhanced File Locking**: Proper file locking with cleanup
3. **Automatic Backups**: Create backups before every write
4. **JSON Validation**: Validate before and after writes
5. **Automatic Recovery**: Restore from backup on corruption

## Key Features

### Safe File Writing
- Write to temporary file first
- Validate JSON before and after write
- Atomic move to target file
- Automatic cleanup on failure

### Enhanced Locking
- File-level locking with fcntl
- Proper cleanup of lock files
- Prevents concurrent access issues

### Automatic Recovery
- Create backups before every write
- Restore from backup on corruption
- Validate backup integrity

### Monitoring
- Real-time file integrity monitoring
- Automatic corruption detection
- Proactive recovery

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from bmad.agents.core.communication.message_bus import publish, get_events

# Publish an event
success = publish("test_event", {"data": "test"})

# Get events
events = get_events()
```

### Monitoring
```bash
python monitor_json_integrity.py
```

### Testing
```bash
python test_robust_message_bus.py
```

## Prevention Measures

1. **Atomic Operations**: All file writes are atomic
2. **Validation**: JSON validated before and after writes
3. **Backups**: Automatic backups before every write
4. **Locking**: Enhanced file locking prevents race conditions
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time integrity monitoring
6. **Recovery**: Automatic recovery from backups

## Root Cause Addressed

- **Process Interruption**: Atomic operations prevent partial writes
- **Concurrent Access**: Enhanced locking prevents race conditions
- **File System Issues**: Validation and recovery handle corruption
- **Memory Issues**: Proper error handling and cleanup
