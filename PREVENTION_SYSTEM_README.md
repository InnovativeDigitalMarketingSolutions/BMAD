# Prevention System Documentation

## Overview
This system implements comprehensive prevention mechanisms to avoid data corruption and system issues.

## Components

### 1. Robust Message Bus
- Atomic operations for file writes
- Enhanced file locking
- Automatic backups
- JSON validation

### 2. Monitoring System
- Real-time file integrity monitoring
- Automatic corruption detection
- Backup restoration
- Alert logging

### 3. Prevention Mechanisms
- Atomic writes prevent partial writes
- File locking prevents race conditions
- Validation prevents invalid data
- Backups prevent data loss

## Usage

### Testing the System
```bash
python test_robust_message_bus.py
```

### Monitoring
```bash
python prevention_monitor_daemon.py
```

### Validation
```bash
python -c "import json; data = json.load(open('bmad/agents/core/shared_context.json')); print(f'Events: {len(data.get("events", []))}')"
```

## Prevention Metrics

### System Reliability
- Uptime: 99.9% target
- Data Integrity: 100% validation
- Recovery Time: < 30 seconds
- Backup Success Rate: 100%

### Monitoring
- File Validation: Every 5 seconds
- Health Checks: Every minute
- Backup Frequency: Before every write
- Alert Response: < 5 minutes

## Best Practices

### Development
- Always use the robust message bus
- Validate data before and after writes
- Create backups before operations
- Monitor system health

### Operations
- Monitor prevention logs
- Respond to alerts quickly
- Regular system health checks
- Continuous improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **JSON Corruption**: Automatic recovery from backup
2. **File Locking**: Automatic timeout and cleanup
3. **Validation Errors**: Detailed error logging
4. **Backup Issues**: Multiple backup strategies

### Recovery Procedures
1. Check prevention logs
2. Validate file integrity
3. Restore from backup if needed
4. Restart monitoring if required

## Success Criteria
