# Orchestrator Agent

## Overview
The Orchestrator agent is the central coordinator for agent workflows, event routing, task assignment, and BMAD collaboration. It manages complex workflows, coordinates between multiple agents, and ensures smooth execution of development processes.

## Enhanced MCP Integration (Phase 2)

### Features
- **Enhanced MCP Tools**: Advanced workflow orchestration and agent coordination capabilities
- **Tracing Integration**: Comprehensive operation tracing for orchestration operations
- **Team Collaboration**: Enhanced communication with other agents for workflow coordination
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time orchestration performance metrics

### Enhanced MCP Commands
- `enhanced-collaborate`: Enhanced inter-agent communication for workflow coordination
- `enhanced-security`: Enhanced security validation for orchestration features
- `enhanced-performance`: Enhanced performance optimization for orchestration tools
- `trace-operation`: Trace orchestration operations
- `trace-performance`: Get performance metrics
- `trace-error`: Trace error scenarios
- `tracing-summary`: Get tracing summary

### Core Functionality
- **Workflow Management**: Comprehensive workflow orchestration and execution
- **Agent Coordination**: Intelligent task assignment and agent coordination
- **Event Routing**: Advanced event routing and message bus management
- **Escalation Management**: Automated escalation handling and resolution
- **Metrics Analysis**: Performance metrics collection and analysis
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: HITL decision points and approval workflows

### Integration Points
- **ProductOwner**: Workflow planning and requirement coordination
- **Scrummaster**: Agile process coordination and sprint management
- **Architect**: Technical architecture coordination and design reviews
- **QualityGuardian**: Quality gate coordination and validation

## Usage

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Start a workflow
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.Orchestrator.orchestrator start-workflow --workflow feature_delivery

# Monitor workflows
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.Orchestrator.orchestrator monitor-workflows

# Orchestrate agents
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.Orchestrator.orchestrator orchestrate-agents --orchestration-type task_assignment

# Enhanced MCP commands
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.Orchestrator.orchestrator enhanced-collaborate
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.Orchestrator.orchestrator trace-operation
```
