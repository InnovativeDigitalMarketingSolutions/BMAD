## Quality-First Implementation & Test Fixes (2025-01-27)

### Added
- **Event Handler Quality Enhancement**: Enhanced all event handlers with real business logic
- **Performance Monitor Integration**: Added `log_metric` method to PerformanceMonitor for consistent metric logging
- **Async Event Handler Consistency**: Made `validate_aria` method async for consistency
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added tests for all event handlers with proper async handling

### Enhanced
- **handle_audit_requested**: Added input validation, metric logging, audit history updates, and error handling
- **handle_audit_completed**: Added input validation, metric logging, audit history updates, policy evaluation, and error handling
- **handle_validation_requested**: Added input validation, metric logging, audit history updates, and error handling
- **handle_improvement_requested**: Added input validation, metric logging, audit history updates, and error handling
- **validate_aria**: Made async for consistency with event handlers

### Fixed
- **Test Async Handling**: Fixed tests to properly await async event handlers
- **Performance Monitor API**: Added missing `log_metric` and `record_metric` methods to PerformanceMonitor
- **Event Handler Return Values**: Ensured all event handlers return `None` for consistency
- **Test Mocking**: Fixed test mocks to use correct method names and async patterns

### Technical Details
- **Quality-First Approach**: Implemented real business logic instead of mock-only solutions
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper logging
- **Metric Tracking**: Integrated performance monitoring with real metric logging
- **History Management**: Added audit history updates for all event handlers
- **Policy Integration**: Integrated policy engine evaluation in event handlers

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Success Rate**: 62/62 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Event Handler Coverage**: 4/4 event handlers fully implemented with quality-first approach
- **Async Consistency**: All async methods properly implemented and tested
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling in all event handlers
