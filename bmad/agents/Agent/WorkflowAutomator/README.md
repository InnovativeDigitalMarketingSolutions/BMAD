# WorkflowAutomator

## Overview
The WorkflowAutomator is responsible for workflow automation, process optimization, and end-to-end execution coordination. It works closely with development teams to automate complex workflows, optimize processes, and ensure efficient execution across multiple agents.

## Enhanced MCP Integration (Phase 2)

### Features
- **Enhanced MCP Tools**: Advanced workflow automation and optimization capabilities
- **Tracing Integration**: Comprehensive operation tracing for workflow operations
- **Team Collaboration**: Enhanced communication with other agents for workflow coordination
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time workflow performance metrics and optimization

### Enhanced MCP Commands
- `enhanced-collaborate`: Enhanced inter-agent communication for workflow coordination
- `enhanced-security`: Enhanced security validation for workflow features
- `enhanced-performance`: Enhanced performance optimization for workflow tools
- `trace-operation`: Trace workflow operations
- `trace-performance`: Get performance metrics
- `trace-error`: Trace error scenarios
- `tracing-summary`: Get tracing summary

### Core Functionality
- **Workflow Creation**: Comprehensive workflow creation and management
- **Workflow Execution**: Automated workflow execution with agent coordination
- **Workflow Optimization**: Intelligent workflow optimization and performance tuning
- **Workflow Monitoring**: Real-time workflow monitoring and alerting
- **Parallel Execution**: Parallel workflow execution for improved performance
- **Conditional Execution**: Conditional workflow execution based on business rules
- **Auto Recovery**: Automated recovery from workflow failures

### Integration Points
- **Orchestrator**: Workflow orchestration and coordination
- **DevOpsInfra**: Infrastructure and deployment workflow coordination
- **QualityGuardian**: Quality assurance workflow integration
- **ReleaseManager**: Release management workflow coordination

## Usage

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Create workflow
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.WorkflowAutomator.workflowautomator create-workflow --name "Feature Development" --agents ProductOwner Scrummaster FrontendDeveloper --commands create-epic create-sprint develop-ui

# Execute workflow
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.WorkflowAutomator.workflowautomator execute-workflow --workflow-id "workflow_123"

# Monitor workflow
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.WorkflowAutomator.workflowautomator monitor-workflow --workflow-id "workflow_123"

# Enhanced MCP commands
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.WorkflowAutomator.workflowautomator enhanced-collaborate
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.WorkflowAutomator.workflowautomator trace-operation
```

### Enhanced MCP Integration
The agent now supports enhanced MCP Phase 2 capabilities including:
- Advanced workflow automation tools
- Real-time workflow performance monitoring
- Comprehensive operation tracing
- Enhanced team collaboration features

## Dependencies
