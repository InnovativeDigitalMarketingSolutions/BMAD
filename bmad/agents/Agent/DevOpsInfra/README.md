# DevOpsInfra Agent

## Overview
The DevOpsInfra agent is responsible for infrastructure management, deployment automation, and DevOps practices. It works closely with development teams to ensure reliable, scalable, and secure infrastructure deployment and management.

## Enhanced MCP Integration (Phase 2)

### Features
- **Enhanced MCP Tools**: Advanced infrastructure management and deployment capabilities
- **Tracing Integration**: Comprehensive operation tracing for infrastructure operations
- **Team Collaboration**: Enhanced communication with other agents for deployment coordination
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time infrastructure performance metrics

### Enhanced MCP Commands
- `enhanced-collaborate`: Enhanced inter-agent communication for deployment coordination
- `enhanced-security`: Enhanced security validation for infrastructure features
- `enhanced-performance`: Enhanced performance optimization for infrastructure tools
- `trace-operation`: Trace infrastructure operations
- `trace-performance`: Get performance metrics
- `trace-error`: Trace error scenarios
- `tracing-summary`: Get tracing summary

### Core Functionality
- **Infrastructure Management**: Cloud infrastructure provisioning and management
- **Deployment Automation**: CI/CD pipeline automation and orchestration
- **Monitoring Setup**: Infrastructure monitoring and alerting configuration
- **Security Scanning**: Security vulnerability scanning and compliance checks
- **Incident Response**: Automated incident detection and response
- **Performance Optimization**: Infrastructure performance tuning and optimization

### Integration Points
- **BackendDeveloper**: Infrastructure requirements and deployment coordination
- **FrontendDeveloper**: Frontend deployment and hosting configuration
- **SecurityDeveloper**: Security compliance and vulnerability management
- **QualityGuardian**: Quality gates and deployment validation

## Usage

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Deploy infrastructure
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.DevOpsInfra.devopsinfra deploy-infrastructure --environment production

# Setup monitoring
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.DevOpsInfra.devopsinfra setup-monitoring --service api-gateway

# Security scan
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.DevOpsInfra.devopsinfra security-scan --target production

# Enhanced MCP commands
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.DevOpsInfra.devopsinfra enhanced-collaborate
python -m bmad.agents.Agent.DevOpsInfra.devopsinfra trace-operation
```
