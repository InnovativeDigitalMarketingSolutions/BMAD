# UX/UI Best Practices

- **Desktop-first, mobile responsive:** Design for desktop first, then make it responsive for mobile/tablet.
- **Consistency:** Use design tokens and component libraries for a consistent look & feel.
- **Accessibility by design:** Ensure sufficient contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels and test with screenreaders.
- **Iterative work:** Gather feedback early and often, work in short iterations.
- **Collaboration:** Work closely with frontend developers, PO, accessibility and test engineers.
- **Documentation:** Document wireframes, component specs and design decisions properly.
- **Feedback loops:** Implement feedback loops with users and team members.
- **User research:** Base design choices on user research and analytics.
