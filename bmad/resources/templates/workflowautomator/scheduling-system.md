# Workflow Scheduling System

## Overview
This template provides guidelines for scheduling workflow execution and managing automated workflows.

## Scheduling Types

### 1. Time-based Scheduling
- **Daily**: Execute workflows daily at specified times
- **Weekly**: Execute workflows weekly on specified days
- **Monthly**: Execute workflows monthly on specified dates
- **Custom**: Execute workflows on custom schedules

### 2. Event-based Scheduling
- **Trigger Events**: Execute workflows based on events
- **Conditional**: Execute workflows based on conditions
- **Dependency**: Execute workflows based on dependencies
- **Manual**: Execute workflows manually

### 3. Resource-based Scheduling
- **Resource Available**: Execute when resources are available
- **Load Balanced**: Execute based on system load
- **Priority Based**: Execute based on priority levels
- **Capacity Based**: Execute based on system capacity

## Scheduling Configuration

### Schedule Formats
- **Cron**: Standard cron format for time-based scheduling
- **Interval**: Time interval-based scheduling
- **Calendar**: Calendar-based scheduling
- **Custom**: Custom scheduling formats

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Highest priority, immediate execution
- **High**: High priority, execute soon
- **Normal**: Normal priority, standard execution
- **Low**: Low priority, execute when resources available

## Scheduling Features

### Advanced Scheduling
- **Recurring**: Recurring workflow execution
- **One-time**: One-time workflow execution
- **Conditional**: Conditional workflow execution
- **Dependent**: Dependent workflow execution

### Scheduling Management
- **Schedule Creation**: Create new schedules
- **Schedule Modification**: Modify existing schedules
- **Schedule Deletion**: Delete schedules
- **Schedule Monitoring**: Monitor schedule execution

## Best Practices

### Schedule Design
1. **Avoid Conflicts**: Avoid scheduling conflicts
2. **Consider Resources**: Consider resource availability
3. **Plan Dependencies**: Plan workflow dependencies
4. **Monitor Performance**: Monitor schedule performance

### Schedule Optimization
1. **Load Distribution**: Distribute load evenly
2. **Resource Utilization**: Optimize resource utilization
3. **Error Handling**: Include error handling in schedules
4. **Recovery Procedures**: Include recovery procedures

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Machine Learning**: ML-based scheduling optimization
- **Predictive Scheduling**: Predictive scheduling capabilities
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Dynamic schedule adjustment
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Intelligent scheduling algorithms
