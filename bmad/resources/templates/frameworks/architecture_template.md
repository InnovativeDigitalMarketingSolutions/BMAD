# Architecture Template

## Overview

Dit template bevat de basis architectuur guidelines voor de Architect agent.

## Architecture Patterns

### Microservices Architecture
- Service decomposition based on business capabilities
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity per service
- Data isolation and consistency patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Asynchronous communication patterns
- Event sourcing and CQRS
- Message queues and event streaming
- Saga patterns for distributed transactions

### API-First Design
- RESTful API design principles
- GraphQL for flexible data queries
- API versioning strategies
- Documentation and testing standards

## Design Principles

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling strategies
- Load balancing and caching
- Database sharding and replication
- Performance optimization patterns

### Security
- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption and privacy
- Security by design principles
- Compliance and audit requirements

### Maintainability
- Clean architecture principles
- Dependency injection and inversion
- Testing strategies and coverage
- Documentation and code standards

## Technology Stack Guidelines

### Backend Technologies
- Python/FastAPI for API development
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Docker for containerization

### Frontend Technologies
- React/Next.js for web applications
- TypeScript for type safety
- State management patterns
- Component library standards

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Monitoring and logging
- Disaster recovery planning

## Quality Gates

### Architecture Review
- Design pattern validation
- Performance impact assessment
- Security review and compliance
- Scalability and maintainability check

### Implementation Standards
- Code quality and standards
- Testing coverage requirements
- Documentation completeness
- Performance benchmarks
