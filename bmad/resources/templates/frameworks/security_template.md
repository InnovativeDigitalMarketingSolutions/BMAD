# Security Framework Template

## Overview

Dit template bevat de framework guidelines voor SecurityDeveloper development en testing. De SecurityDeveloper is verantwoordelijk voor security best practices, vulnerability scanning, incident response en compliance.

## Development Guidelines

### Core Principles
- **Security by Design**: Security wordt vanaf het begin meegenomen in alle development
- **Defense in Depth**: Meerdere security lagen voor maximale bescherming

#### Vulnerability Management
- Implementeer automated vulnerability scanning
- Gebruik dependency scanning voor known vulnerabilities
- Implementeer security code review process
- Gebruik penetration testing voor security validation
- Implementeer security patch management

#### Security Monitoring
- Implementeer security event logging
- Gebruik intrusion detection systems
- Implementeer security analytics en threat detection
- Gebruik security dashboards en reporting
- Implementeer security alerting en notification

#### Incident Response
- Implementeer security incident response plan
