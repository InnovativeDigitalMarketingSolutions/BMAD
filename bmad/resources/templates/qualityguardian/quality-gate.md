# Quality Gate Template

## Overview
This template defines quality gates and checkpoints that must be passed before code can be deployed to production, ensuring consistent quality standards.

## Quality Gate Components

### 1. Code Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum test coverage requirements
- **Code Complexity**: Maximum complexity thresholds
- **Code Duplication**: Maximum duplication percentage
- **Code Smells**: Maximum number of code smells allowed

### 2. Security Gates
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Security**: All dependencies must be secure
- **Secret Detection**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- **Security Compliance**: Meet security standards and policies

### 3. Performance Gates
- **Response Time**: Maximum acceptable response times
- **Throughput**: Minimum throughput requirements
- **Resource Usage**: Maximum resource consumption limits
- **Performance Regression**: No performance degradation

### 4. Functional Gates
- **Test Results**: All tests must pass
- **Integration Tests**: All integration tests must pass
- **API Compatibility**: Backward compatibility maintained
- **Feature Completeness**: All required features implemented

## Quality Gate Process

### Pre-Deployment Checks
1. **Automated Quality Gates**: Run automated quality checks
2. **Manual Review**: Perform manual code review
3. **Security Review**: Conduct security assessment
4. **Performance Validation**: Validate performance metrics

### Gate Evaluation
1. **Threshold Checking**: Compare metrics against thresholds
2. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze quality trends over time
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate deployment risks
4. **Approval Process**: Obtain necessary approvals

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. **Health Monitoring**: Monitor application health
2. **Performance Tracking**: Track performance metrics
3. **Error Monitoring**: Monitor error rates and issues
4. **User Feedback**: Collect and analyze user feedback

## Quality Gate Thresholds

### Code Quality Thresholds
| Metric | Warning | Critical | Action Required |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Test Coverage | < 80% | < 70% | Increase test coverage |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | > 10 | > 15 | Refactor complex code |
| Code Duplication | > 5% | > 10% | Reduce code duplication |
| Code Smells | > 10 | > 20 | Fix code smells |

### Security Thresholds
| Metric | Warning | Critical | Action Required |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Critical Vulnerabilities | > 0 | > 0 | Fix immediately |
| High Vulnerabilities | > 0 | > 2 | Fix within 24 hours |
| Medium Vulnerabilities | > 5 | > 10 | Fix within 1 week |
| Outdated Dependencies | > 5% | > 10% | Update dependencies |

### Performance Thresholds
| Metric | Warning | Critical | Action Required |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Response Time | > 500ms | > 1000ms | Optimize performance |
| Error Rate | > 1% | > 5% | Fix errors immediately |
| CPU Usage | > 80% | > 90% | Scale infrastructure |
| Memory Usage | > 80% | > 90% | Optimize memory usage |

## Quality Gate Implementation

### Automated Gates
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions quality gate
- name: Quality Gate Check
  run: |
    # Run tests and collect coverage
    coverage run -m pytest
    coverage report --fail-under=80
    
    # Run security scan
    bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json
    safety check --json --output safety-report.json
    
    # Run performance tests
    python performance_test.py
    
    # Generate quality report
    python quality_gate_analyzer.py
```

### Manual Gates
1. **Code Review**: Peer review of all changes
2. **Security Review**: Security team approval
3. **Architecture Review**: Architecture team approval
4. **Business Approval**: Product owner approval
