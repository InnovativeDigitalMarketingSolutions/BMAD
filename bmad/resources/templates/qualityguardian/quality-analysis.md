# Quality Analysis Template

## Overview
This template provides guidelines for comprehensive code quality analysis including complexity metrics, maintainability scores, and technical debt assessment.

## Analysis Components

### 1. Code Complexity Analysis
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measure decision points and control flow
- **Cognitive Complexity**: Assess code readability and understanding difficulty
- **Nesting Depth**: Evaluate code structure and readability

### 2. Maintainability Metrics
- **Maintainability Index**: Overall code maintainability score
- **Code Duplication**: Percentage of duplicated code
- **Code Smells**: Identify problematic patterns and anti-patterns

### 3. Technical Debt Assessment
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Quantify accumulated technical debt
- **Debt Categories**: Security, Performance, Maintainability, Testability
- **Remediation Priority**: High, Medium, Low priority fixes

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Static Analysis
1. Run static code analysis tools
2. Collect complexity metrics
3. Identify code smells and violations
4. Generate initial quality report

### Step 2: Dynamic Analysis
1. Analyze runtime performance
2. Assess memory usage patterns
3. Evaluate resource utilization
4. Monitor error rates and exceptions

### Step 3: Quality Assessment
1. Calculate quality scores
2. Identify improvement areas
3. Prioritize remediation actions
4. Generate recommendations

## Quality Thresholds

### Acceptable Ranges
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: < 10 per method
- **Maintainability Index**: > 65
- **Code Duplication**: < 5%
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: < 5%

### Warning Levels
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 10-15 (Warning), > 15 (Critical)
- **Maintainability Index**: 50-65 (Warning), < 50 (Critical)
- **Code Duplication**: 5-10% (Warning), > 10% (Critical)
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: 5-10% (Warning), > 10% (Critical)

## Reporting Format

### Quality Report Structure
```json
{
  "analysis_id": "unique_identifier",
  "timestamp": "ISO_8601_timestamp",
  "code_quality_score": 85,
  "complexity_score": 7.2,
  "maintainability_index": 78,
  "duplication_percentage": 3.5,
  "code_smells": ["Long method", "Complex condition"],
  "technical_debt": "Low",
  "recommendations": [
    "Refactor long methods",
    "Simplify complex conditions",
    "Add more unit tests"
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Code Quality Guidelines
1. **Keep methods small and focused** (< 20 lines)
2. **Limit complexity** (cyclomatic complexity < 10)
3. **Avoid code duplication** (DRY principle)
4. **Use meaningful names** for variables and methods
5. **Add comprehensive tests** (aim for >80% coverage)

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Regular quality reviews** (weekly/monthly)
2. **Automated quality gates** in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Technical debt tracking** and management
4. **Team quality awareness** and training

## Tools and Integration

### Recommended Tools
- **SonarQube**: Comprehensive code quality analysis
- **Pylint**: Python code analysis and linting
- **Flake8**: Style guide enforcement
- **Coverage.py**: Test coverage measurement
- **Radon**: Python code metrics

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Code Quality Analysis
  run: |
    pip install radon coverage
    radon cc . -a
    coverage run -m pytest
    coverage report
```

## Quality Metrics Dashboard

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Code Quality Score**: Target > 80
- **Test Coverage**: Target > 80%
- **Technical Debt**: Target < 5%
- **Code Smells**: Target < 10 per 1000 lines

### Trend Analysis
- Track quality metrics over time
- Identify quality degradation patterns
- Monitor improvement initiatives
- Report quality trends to stakeholders
