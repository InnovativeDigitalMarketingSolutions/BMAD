# DevOps/Infra Best Practices

## Infrastructure as Code
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
- Ensure version-controlled infrastructure
- Build modular and reusable infrastructure components
- Implement infrastructure testing and validation

## CI/CD Pipelines
- Build automated CI/CD pipelines
- Implement continuous integration and deployment
- Ensure automated testing and quality gates
- Monitor pipeline performance and reliability

## Containerization & Orchestration
- Implement containerization using Docker
- Ensure container orchestration using Kubernetes
- Build scalable and resilient container platforms
- Monitor container performance and security

## Monitoring & Observability
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Ensure log aggregation and analysis
- Build observability dashboards and metrics
- Monitor application and infrastructure health

## Desktop-First, Mobile Responsive
- Ensure desktop-first infrastructure design
- Implement mobile-responsive deployment strategies
- Test infrastructure on various devices
- Monitor cross-platform performance

## Collaboration
The DevOps/Infra Agent works with:
- **Product Owner:** For infrastructure requirements and scaling
- **Scrummaster:** For deployment planning and releases
- **Frontend Developer:** For frontend deployment and hosting
- **Backend Developer:** For backend deployment and APIs
- **Fullstack Developer:** For end-to-end deployment
- **Test Engineer:** For test environment and CI/CD integration
- **Security Developer:** For infrastructure security and compliance
- **UX/UI Designer:** For deployment and hosting requirements
- **AI Developer:** For AI model deployment and infrastructure
- **Data Engineer:** For data infrastructure and pipelines
- **Architect:** For infrastructure architecture and design
- **Documentation Agent:** For infrastructure documentation
- **Release Manager:** For deployment and release management
- **Feedback Agent:** For infrastructure feedback and monitoring
- **R&D:** For infrastructure innovation and experiments
- **Strategie Partner:** For infrastructure strategy and roadmap
